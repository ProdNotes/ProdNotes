# RNV

Cloud & Platform Engineer focused on building **production-grade infrastructure and delivery systems**.

I work at the intersection of cloud architecture, DevOps, and platform reliability — designing systems that are **boring to operate, predictable to scale, and easy to reason about**.

---

## Focus Areas

- Cloud infrastructure design and operations
- Platform engineering & internal developer platforms
- CI/CD systems and deployment automation
- Kubernetes-based runtime platforms
- Infrastructure as Code and system standardization
- Observability, reliability, and operational readiness

---

## Technical Stack

**Cloud**
- AWS

**Containers & Platforms**
- Docker
- Kubernetes

**Infrastructure as Code**
- Terraform

**CI/CD**
- GitHub Actions
- Azure DevOps

**Observability**
- Prometheus
- Grafana

**Systems**
- Linux
- Bash

## Engineering Principles

- Production systems favor clarity over cleverness  
- Automation is a prerequisite, not an optimization  
- Reliability and operability are first-class features  
- Documentation is part of the system  
- Consistency scales better than heroics  

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- End-to-end infrastructure and platform examples
- Opinionated but practical implementations
- Repositories that reflect **real operational concerns**
- Minimal demos — maximal focus on maintainability

---

## Current Direction

Building and refining reusable infrastructure patterns that mirror **real-world production environments**, with emphasis on:
- repeatability
- safety
- operational confidence
