# RNV  
**Principal Cloud & Platform Architect (SaaS / Product)**

Designing **production-grade cloud platforms** that scale to millions of users, hundreds of services, and multiple teams — with reliability, cost efficiency, and developer experience as first-class concerns.

---

## 🧭 Architecture Focus
- Cloud & platform architecture (AWS)
- Platform engineering & internal developer platforms
- CI/CD systems as platforms (not pipelines)
- Kubernetes runtime platforms at scale
- Infrastructure as Code & standardization
- Observability, reliability, and operational readiness

---

## ⚙️ Scale & Impact
- **Traffic:** ~100k requests/sec  
- **Users:** ~1.1 million  
- **Services:** 200+ microservices  
- **Environments:** Multi-region (Dev → Prod)  
- **Teams Enabled:** 10+

## 🧩 Architecture Case Studies

### 🚦 Feature-Flag–Driven CI/CD Platform
Designed a **platform-level CI/CD system** where deployment capabilities are enabled via feature flags instead of per-service Helm complexity.

- Autoscaling, rollout strategies, operational add-ons
- Secure networking patterns (DMZ / VSR)
- Consistent deployments across 200+ services

**Outcome:** Strong developer experience, reduced deployment risk, standardized delivery.

---

### 📈 Automated Performance Testing Platform
Architected an end-to-end CI/CD-integrated performance testing system using JMeter.

- Automated controller & worker provisioning
- Load testing up to **60k RPS**
- Results stored in S3 with web-based visualization
- Automatic teardown for cost efficiency

---

## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy
- Production systems favor clarity over cleverness  
- Automation is mandatory, not optional  
- Reliability and operability are first-class features  
- Platforms should reduce cognitive load  
- Consistency scales better than heroics

## 🎯 Current Direction
Operating at **Principal Engineer / Architect** level, focused on:
- Platform architectures that scale across teams
- Reusable infrastructure patterns
- Safe, predictable delivery systems
- Designing systems that are boring to operate — and hard to break
